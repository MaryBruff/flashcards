## Abstract 

This application was developed to enable players to assess their JavaScript knowledge through a terminal-based game. Players engage in an interactive quiz, answering JavaScript-related questions within the command line environment. After answering all the questions, the application provides a percentage score that reflects the user's performance!  This game includes the requirement for a score of 90% or higher to avoid going through the dataset again. Anything at 80% or lower, the player may need to review the material.
